#### About
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and deployed on HeroKu [here](https://secret-depths-79980.herokuapp.com).

It is a practice while I was learning React from this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AbaV3nrw6E&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBuKtLgPR_zWYnrwv-JllpA&index=1). You can find the code on github for this video [here](https://github.com/buckyroberts/React-Boilerplate). 

#### What it can do:
1. Create a new comment with default text by clicking 'Create A Comment' button.
2. Edit existing comment and save.
3. Delete comments.

Plus:
I found an artical useful for deploying react apps on Heroku, you can check [here](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).
